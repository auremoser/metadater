metadater
=========

An NSA-style dating site, powered by open browse of singles' online metadata for developing only the most meaningful and subconscious connections.

##Preface
The subtlties of invasive citizen surveillance and the complications of online dating are two unsolved problem sets, with inverse complications. One reveals too much about those surveilled, the other relies on inaccurate UGC and reveals too little about those self-represented. What if we combine them and kill two birds? Enter **Metadater**, a project that aims to educate participants in the personality profile made possible by compiled metadata! 

##Problem
**Metadater** attempts to address both of the aforementioned problem sets.

In *communicating or publishing* online… 

1. People do not understand the metadata embedded in their online interactions.
2. This lack of understanding blocks them from groking the gravity of metadata surveillance projects.  

In *dating* online…  

1. Online profiles are subjective and largely inaccurate due to our disproportionate appreciation of our own merits.
2. People
3. People often fail to address those issues that lead to break ups (cleanliness/sleeping habits/schedule dynamics) and thereby set themselves up for dissappointment in relationships.

We all want to get better at these things. **Metadater** can help.

##Plan
We've started this repo to begin brainstorming about the topic. Our project might involve an opt-in email service, where we mine participants email for metadata and match them with others who share their communication patterns, who cluster around similar nichw topics, and whose timestamps reflect a similar geolocation, similar sleeping patterns ;). The project might pull from public media resources, to dissect particpants' social behaviors online, and provide them partners with similar preoccupations.   

Eventually, ideas will take shape and populate [metadat.es](http://metadat.es/).

###Scenario
Semtiment analysis of UGC text in social media has lead us to mood mapping applications that can detect how people self-profess feelings, but metadata that wraps this content in some context provides so much more. 

Let's consider a tweet, 140 characters of content but encased in a complex skeleton of data.  

![Tweet Metadata](https://raw.github.com/auremoser/metadater/master/Imgs/tweet-map.png)

This could tell a participant when you created your account, when you entered the realm of social media. It could tell them about your behavioral habits to reply_to_user_ids often, and your frequency of "favourites_count"s which could reveal your social support for friends, your engagement with others online, your openness to collaboration and relationships. It could speak to your propensity for posting cat videos at 2am EST, and the status of your privacy settings (and by syllogism your private life). It could speak to your chosen language of preference, potentially linked to your ethnic heritage; it could compose GeoJSON tags or place_ids about your location or place_type for proximity to other participants. Depending on the trucation of your messages (truncated=>true) it could tell if you tweet from a mobile device, if you're often mobile and where you go (ge_enables=>true).  

When mapped to some content and keyword clusters, it could paint a pretty thorough picture of your online patterns.

###Additional Research
This repo also includes:  

* Backlog for project planning
* Resources directory, basically a bucket list of data sources.
