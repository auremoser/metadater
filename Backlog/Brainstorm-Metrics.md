## Original Idea
This came up during a conversation last weekend during a fun trip to
weird California places. One person in the car recently started
sort-of-dating someone and thinks that it's important to have matches
on "lifestyle" things like sleeping patterns and messiness of the
apartment. On the other hand, she didn't find it a problem that her
[future-]boyfriend likes cooking and she doesn't.


I don't really know whether there is a real distinction here; it might
be that it's actully better if both people like cooking. Or it might be
that there's really a meta-similarity in a desire for one person to
be cooking and the other not to be....


Our thinking in the car was that the things that are better off being
the same are the things that you are sort of forced to share if you
live together; it's mostly agreement on the attributes of the
house/apartment/yurt/&c.


This sort of reasoning might be a fun way to focus the surveillance;
maybe we start by guessing sleep patterns based on how people use
Facebook and Twitter.


### Topics to test
This is a brain dump of typical things people seem to take issue with:
1. Experience (on person has lots of relationship experience, the other doesn’t)
2. Age (age determines stage in life usually, so some people break up because their stage dictates a different relationship status)
3. Family/Inlaw issues
4. Messiness
5. Friends don’t like him/her
6. Patterns differ (sleep, work, ambition, appetite for adventure)
7. Exes are too influential on current life (maybe there’s a way we can calculate when is the optimal time lapsed to “get over” a previous relationship and then calculate “suitability for dating now” from that)

### Sample treatment
I wonder how we could test that comparison (sleep ->> social habits). sleeping is a complex series of micro habits.
1. position (front/back orientation, leg extension, top/bottom/diagonal orientation)
2. sound/breathing (deviated septum/not, snoring?, teeth grinding, mumbling, laughing [i laugh a lot in my sleep, so it's a thing])
3. dreaming (do you dream and when/what stage and is your dreaming pattern vocal/disruptive?)
4. cycle (do you wake up, sleep apnea?, what is your typical sleep pattern, night owl/early bird? average # of hours, light/heavy sleeper?)
5. ideal feel (do you like to be warm/cozy/cool, do you flip the pillow to the cool side?, allergies to goosefeathers?, are you a cuddler?, big spoon/little spoon?)


Then there are other things too, and some of them are more fun to not predict and just figure out with someone you love. So I don't know how much of that is inferable from social behaviors. We could spoof it and say that maybe if you frequently reply to tweets, you like to be spooned, held, cared for; if you always use a maximum of characters, you like to have space, to spread out to the frontiers of your sleeping surface? I don't really know what you could tell about something so unconscious and intimate as sleeping from social media. There are probably things, I'm just too dull to figure them out this morning.
